# HotelApp
This application is made mostly for practicing C# along with .NET framework. I wanted to take a dip in something different than Frontend with JS as it's main workhorse, what I wanted to check out especially is OOP as compared to JS procedural / functional approach to programming. 
Frontend will be minimal during API development, since Backend is my main focus now - I am testing it out with Postman for now and along with debugger it is going pretty smooth. When I'm mostly finished with shiny cool stuff (for me) on the Backend side I'll finish the UI.
